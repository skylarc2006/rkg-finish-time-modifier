# RKG Finish Time Modifier
Modifies displayed finish time of a Mario Kart Wii RKG ghost file. Can only personally confirm this works with uncompressed vanilla RKGs but should work for others?

## Download

## Usage
Pass in the file path of the RKG as a command-line argument (on Windows dragging and dropping the RKG file on top of the exe works). Outputs a copy of the ghost file in the same directory as the original ghost.
